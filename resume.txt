PUBLICATION: Construction of Hyperspectral Images from RGB Images via CNN
This research addressed the challenge of generating hyperspectral images from standard RGB using deep convolutional neural networks. Hyperspectral imaging captures information across many wavelengths, useful in medicine and environmental monitoring. The proposed 3D CNN model converts RGB inputs into hyperspectral bands, providing a more accessible and cost-efficient alternative to expensive hyperspectral cameras. Core concepts involved: CNNs, spectral reconstruction, image-to-image translation, dataset preprocessing, and model evaluation.
